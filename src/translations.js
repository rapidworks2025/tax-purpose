My goal is sustainable tax consulting and tax planning for sustainable companies – tax optimization for your sustainable business model and maximizing your positive societal impact. At the same time, I advise on sustainable corporate forms: structures where profit maximization for founders, shareholders, and investors is not the priority, and profits remain within the company to be invested in social and sustainable projects. My consulting aims to help companies find the balance between a responsible and transparent tax strategy on one hand, and tax-optimized solutions for sustainable business models on the other."

          question: "What is Social Entrepreneurship?",
          answer: `
            <p>Social Entrepreneurship refers to entrepreneurial activity dedicated to positive societal change, the common good, solving social problems, or protecting the environment.</p>
            <p>The concept has become a major international trend in recent years, based on the growing belief that an entrepreneurial approach can achieve the most sustainable social value.</p>
            <p>Social enterprises thus occupy a middle ground between purely charitable and purely commercial organizations. They can be non-profit, i.e., organized without the intention of making a profit. However, especially in modern forms like commercial UGs or GmbHs, they often aim for profits, but these are typically withdrawn only to a small extent. Mostly, they are reinvested to secure funding and impact. Maximizing positive social impact is the primary goal, surpassing profit maximization. With this approach, social entrepreneurs represent a new entrepreneurial self-image and change the interplay between market, state, and social systems.</p>
            <p>Additionally, there are Eco Entrepreneurs. Eco Entrepreneurs focus more on environmental protection and sustainability, while Social Entrepreneurs aim to solve social problems. Although Social and Eco Entrepreneurship are distinct forms, they often overlap.</p>

          question: "What does Purpose Economy mean?",
          answer: `
            <p>"Purpose" means aim or meaning. In a business context, it signifies that companies commit to a deeper corporate mission. Unlike the classic shareholder approach, companies in the Purpose Economy prioritize value orientation over profit orientation.</p>
            <p>Pioneers of sustainable business practices treat environmental, social, and economic issues as equals. Many companies dedicated to a sustainable purpose are turning away from purely capitalist economic understanding, striving for an economic transformation that better serves people (common good) and the planet (preserving natural resources) by prioritizing social and ecological values over pure profit maximization.</p>

          question: "What is Steward Ownership?",
          answer: `
            <p>Steward Ownership is an alternative to conventional ownership structures. It means that control over the company and strategic decisions remain with people active in or closely associated with the company. Two central principles exist:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Self-determination Principle:</strong> Ensures company values are upheld long-term, voting rights are not automatically inherited, and companies do not become speculative assets.</li>
              <li><strong>Purpose Principle:</strong> Ensures profits and assets are primarily used for company development, reinvested, or donated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2019, the "Stiftung Verantwortungseigentum" (Foundation for Steward Ownership) was founded to establish a legal form enabling companies to transition to steward ownership. In Germany, over 200 companies already operate under steward ownership, such as Ecosia, Zeiss, or Alnatura.</p>

          question: "What does ESG mean?",
          answer: `
            <p>The ESG definition encompasses three sustainability-related responsibility areas for organizations: Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G). ESG criteria serve as a corporate tool and framework to capture, analyze, measure, and assess companies' sustainability efforts.</p>
            <p>Data collected under ESG serves companies, among other things, as a basis for sustainability strategies and reports (ESG reporting). The latter allows companies to showcase their efforts and measures in sustainability, climate protection, and CO₂ reduction, presenting themselves as responsible entities to employees, customers, suppliers, or investors. In the context of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), certain companies are already required to collect ESG data and produce ESG reports.</p>
            <p>Rating agencies also use ESG criteria and data to assess corporate sustainability (ESG ratings), enabling investors to align their investment decisions with sustainability.</p>

            question: "What do Tax Transparency & Sustainability mean?",
            answer: `
                <p>Sustainability aspects increasingly shape the tax and legal framework in which companies operate.</p>
                <p>Tax sustainability reporting refers to the disclosure and reporting of tax information by companies within their sustainability reports. Companies report, for example, on their tax strategy, their Tax Risk Management System (TRMS), their stakeholder engagement, and disclose tax-relevant key figures.</p>
                <p>The importance of tax reporting has evolved over many years. Recently, the reporting landscape has been strongly influenced by the EU, through the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the public CbCR Directive.</p>
                <p>Established standards like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct, and the WEF Metrics also play a significant role in reporting on tax matters.</p>

            answer: `
                <p>ESG is relevant for tax in areas including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tax Transparency & Sustainability:</strong> See above.</li>
                    <li><strong>VAT (Value Added Tax):</strong> Various impacts are possible, e.g., preferential VAT rates (like the zero rate) for certain green products/services; reclassification of waste as raw material in the circular economy requiring VAT adjustments; new business models due to sustainable market activities needing careful assessment of supply/service relationships.

                    <li><strong>Electricity & Energy Tax:</strong> The EU's new Energy Taxation Directive introduces fundamental changes, taxing energy products based on energy content and environmental performance rather than volume. Environmentally harmful fuels will be taxed higher. It includes tax incentives for renewable energies (solar, wind, hydro) and promotes innovative technologies like green hydrogen and energy storage. (<a href="https://www.topic.pwc.de/climate-transition/tls-esg-2024-08-06/strom-energiesteuer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:underline">More info - PwC Electricity & Energy Tax</a>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Transactions and Structuring in Renewable Energies:</strong> The shift to renewables (PV, onshore/offshore wind), e-mobility, and changes in heat supply require specialized tax structuring and transaction advice for energy companies, financial investors, and other industries. Aspects include corporate structure, financing, tax location choice, and international tax planning.

                    <li><strong>Transfer Pricing:</strong> In the ESG context, transfer pricing involves determining who performs which functions, bears which risks, and uses which assets (tangible/intangible) for cross-border intra-group transactions. The question is whether new functions are being established due to sustainability/ESG requirements. (<a href="https://www.topic.pwc.de/climate-transition/tls-esg-2024-08-06/transfer-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:underline">More info - PwC Transfer Pricing</a>)</li>
                    <li><strong>HR and Compensation / Taxes:</strong> Integrating ESG-compliant compensation components (e.g., public transport subsidies, bike allowances, further training, childcare support, fair pay structures, employee participation) helps companies meet social responsibilities, boost employee engagement, and minimize tax/legal risks. (<a href="https://www.topic.pwc.de/climate-transition/tls-esg-2024-08-06/employment-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent hover:underline">More info - PwC Employment Tax</a>)</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsidies / Funding:</strong> Federal ministries and the EU Commission provide funding for projects focusing on climate/environmental protection, sustainability, or closed-loop value chains. Identifying and strategically applying for these subsidies (including tax relief/incentives for renewables) is crucial for financing ESG goals (green finance).

                    <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> ESG tax considerations include utilizing potential for renewable energy on properties tax-optimally while managing risks (commercial income, VAT); conducting Tax Due Diligence with ESG focus during acquisitions; and establishing ESG/tax-optimized holding structures to prevent price discounts upon exit.

            <p>International tax law generally encompasses all norms of German tax law with a cross-border dimension. Key components include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs):</strong> Regulate how income and assets are taxed between participating states to avoid double taxation and under-taxation.</li>

          question: "Where does consulting in international tax law apply?",
          answer: `
            <p>In the international context, double taxation can occur for individuals, partnerships, or corporations when the same income or assets are taxed in two or more countries.</p>
            <p>For both "inbound" investments (foreigners investing in Germany) and "outbound" investments (residents investing abroad), different tax systems and rates are key factors for the tax burden of internationally operating companies.</p>
            <p>When planning cross-border investments, it's crucial to examine early how these investments affect the tax burden and what alternatives exist, e.g., through appropriate structuring.</p>
            <p>Consulting in international tax law includes areas like:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Avoiding Double Taxation:</strong> Central focus using DTAs and national rules.</li>
              <li><strong>Risk Analysis and Assessment:</strong> Identifying, evaluating, and developing strategies to minimize tax risks associated with international activities.</li>

            <p>Das Konzept des Social Entrepreneurship hat sich in den letzten Jahren zu einem großen internationalen Trend entwickelt. Diesem liegt die wachsende Überzeugung zugrunde, dass man mit einem unternehmerischen Ansatz den nachhaltigsten gesellschaftlichen Mehrwert erzielen kann.</p>
            <p>Sozialunternehmen liegen demnach in einem Mittelfeld zwischen rein wohltätigen und rein kommerziellen Organisationen. Sie können gemeinnützig, d.h. ohne Gewinnerzielungsabsicht organisiert sein. Vor allem in den modernen Formen als gewerblich tätige UGs oder GmbHs streben sie jedoch oft eigene Gewinne an, aber diese werden höchstens in kleinem Maße abgeschöpft. Größtenteils werden sie reinvestiert, um die eigene Finanzierung und Wirkung zu sichern. Die Maximierung einer positiven sozialen Wirkung (Impact) ist das angestrebte Ziel und überholt das Streben nach Gewinnmaximierung: Mit diesem Ansatz stehen Social Entrepreneure für ein neues unternehmerisches Selbstverständnis und verändern das Zusammenspiel zwischen Markt, Staat und Sozialwesen.</p>
            <p>Darüber hinaus spricht man auch von Eco Entrepreneuren. Eco Entrepreneure konzentrieren sich verstärkt auf Umweltschutz und Nachhaltigkeit, während Social Entrepreneure soziale Probleme lösen wollen. Social und Eco Entrepeneurship sind zwar zwei unterschiedliche Ausprägungen des Entrepreneurships, überschneiden sich jedoch sehr häufig.</p>

          question: "Was bedeutet Purpose Economy?",
          answer: `
            <p>Purpose übersetzt bedeutet Zweck oder Sinn. Im unternehmerischen Kontext ist damit gemeint, dass sich Unternehmen einer tiefergehenden Unternehmensmission verpflichten. Im Gegensatz zum klassischen Shareholder-Ansatz steht bei Unternehmen der Purpose Economy Werteorientierung vor Profitorientierung.</p>
            <p>Die Pioniere der nachhaltigen Wirtschaftsweise zeichnet aus, dass sie die drei Themen Umwelt, Soziales und Wirtschaftlichkeit als gleichberechtigt betrachten. Viele Unternehmen, die sich einem nachhaltigen Unternehmenszweck verschrieben haben, kehren dem rein kapitalistischen Wirtschaftsverständnis den Rücken zu und streben eine Transformation der Wirtschaft an, die den Menschen (Wohl der Allgemeinheit) und dem Planeten (Erhalt unserer natürlichen Lebensgrundlagen) besser dient, indem sie soziale und ökologische Werte vor die reine Profitmaximierung stellt.</p>

          question: "Was versteht man unter Verantwortungseigentum?",
          answer: `
            <p>Verantwortungseigentum ist eine Alternative zu herkömmlichen Eigentumsstrukturen. Es bedeutet, dass die Kontrolle über das Unternehmen und strategische Entscheidungen in Händen von Menschen bleiben, die im Unternehmen tätig oder eng mit demselben verbunden sind. Hierbei existieren zwei zentrale Prinzipien.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Das Selbstbestimmungsprinzip:</strong> Es stellt sicher, dass Unternehmenswerte langfristig getragen, Stimmrechte nicht automatisch weitervererbt und somit Unternehmen nicht zu Spekulationsgütern werden.</li>
              <li><strong>Das Sinnprinzip:</strong> Es sorgt dafür, dass die Gewinne und Vermögen hauptsächlich für die Unternehmensentwicklung verwendet und reinvestiert oder gespendet werden.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2019 gründete sich hierzu die "Stiftung Verantwortungseigentum", mit dem Ziel eine Rechtsform zu etablieren, mit Hilfe derer Unternehmen in Verantwortungseigentum überführt werden können. In Deutschland befinden sich bereits über 200 Unternehmen in Verantwortungseigentum, wie z.B. Ecosia, Zeiss oder Alnatura.</p>

          question: "Was versteht man unter ESG?",
          answer: `
            <p>Die ESG-Definition umfasst mit Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung drei nachhaltigkeitsbezogene Verantwortungsbereiche von Organisationen. Der Begriff "ESG" ist die Abkürzung der entsprechenden englischen Begriffe Environmental (E), Social (S) und Governance (G). Als ESG-Kriterien stellen sie ein unternehmerisches Instrument und Regelwerk dar, um die Bemühungen der Unternehmen im Bereich Nachhaltigkeit zu erfassen, zu analysieren, messbar zu machen und zu beurteilen.</p>
            <p>Die im Rahmen von ESG erhobenen Daten dienen Unternehmen unter anderem als Grundlage für Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien und -berichte (ESG-Reportings). Letztere bieten die Möglichkeit, die unternehmerischen Bemühungen und Maßnahmen im Bereich Nachhaltigkeit, Klimaschutz und Einsparung von CO₂ sichtbar zu machen und sich bei Mitarbeitenden, Kunden, Lieferanten oder Investoren als verantwortungsvolles Unternehmen zu präsentieren. Im Zusammenhang mit der Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) sind bestimmte Unternehmen bereits verpflichtet, ESG-Daten zu erheben und ESG-Reportings zu erstellen.</p>
            <p>Gleichzeitig nutzen Rating-Agenturen ESG-Kriterien und -Daten, um die Nachhaltigkeit von Unternehmen zu bewerten (ESG-Ratings). Dadurch haben Investoren die Möglichkeit, ihre Investitionsentscheidungen gezielt auf Nachhaltigkeit auszurichten.</p>

            question: "Was bedeutet steuerliche Transparenz & Nachhaltigkeit?",
            answer: `
                <p>Nachhaltigkeitsaspekte bestimmen zunehmend den steuerlichen und rechtlichen Rahmen, in dem Unternehmen agieren.</p>
                <p>Steuerliche Nachhaltigkeitsberichterstattung bezieht sich auf die Offenlegung und Berichterstattung von steuerlichen Informationen durch Unternehmen im Rahmen ihrer Nachhaltigkeitssberichte. Unternehmen berichten z.B. über ihre Steuerstrategie, ihr Tax Risk Management System (TRMS), ihren Umgang mit Stakeholdern und legen steuerrelevante Kennzahlen offen.</p>
                <p>Die Bedeutung der steuerlichen Berichterstattung hat sich über viele Jahre hinweg entwickelt. Zuletzt wurde die Reporting-Landschaft stark von der EU geprägt, durch die Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) und die public CbCR-Richtlinie.</p>
                <p>Aber auch etablierte Standards wie die Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), das Standard&Poor's Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, die OECD-Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct und die WEF-Metrics spielen eine wichtige Rolle für die Berichterstattung rund um das Thema Steuern.</p>

            question: "In welchen Bereichen ist ESG steuerlich relevant?",
            answer: `
                <p>ESG ist steuerlich u.a. in folgenden Bereichen relevant:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Steuerliche Transparenz & Nachhaltigkeit:</strong> Siehe hierzu "Was bedeutet steuerliche Transparenz & Nachhaltigkeit"</li>
                    <li><strong>Umsatzsteuer:</strong> Hier sind vielfältige Auswirkungen denkbar, von denen exemplarisch nur einige erwähnt werden: Bestimmte Produkte und Dienstleistungen werden umsatzsteuerlich z.B. über den Nullsteuersatz begünstigt (umsatzsteuerliche Förderung grüner Technologien). Im Zusammenhang mit der Kreislaufwirtschaft können bisherige Abfälle nun als Rohstoff qualifizieren - mit eventuell erforderlichen Anpassungen in der umsatzsteuerlichen Würdigung. Ein nachhaltiges Agieren am Markt kann zu neuen Geschäftsmodellen und neuen Angebotsstrukturen führen. Dies erfordert eine sorgsame Würdigung der zu Grunde liegenden Liefer- und Leistungsbeziehungen.

                    <li><strong>Strom- & Energiesteuer:</strong> Die neue Energiesteuerrichtlinie der EU führt grundlegende Änderungen bei der Besteuerung von Energieprodukten ein, mit dem Ziel, den Übergang zu einer nachhaltigen und klimaneutralen Energieversorgung zu unterstützen. Anstatt Energieprodukte nach Volumen zu besteuern, wird die Besteuerung nach ihrem Energiegehalt und ihrer Umweltleistung erfolgen. Umweltschädlichere Brennstoffe werden höher besteuert. Die Richtlinie sieht steuerliche Anreize für erneuerbare Energien vor und fördert innovative Technologien wie grünen Wasserstoff und Energiespeicher.

                    <li><strong>Transaktionen und Strukturierungen im Bereich erneuerbare Energien:</strong> Die Umstellung auf erneuerbare Energien (PV, Wind), E-Mobilität oder Wärmeversorgung erfordern spezialisierte steuerliche Strukturierungs- und Transaktionsberatung für Energieunternehmen, Investoren etc. Aspekte umfassen Gesellschaftsstruktur, Finanzierung, Standortwahl und internationale Steuerplanung.

                    <li><strong>Verrechnungspreise:</strong> Im ESG-Kontext geht es darum, wer welche Funktionen übernimmt, Risiken trägt und Güter einsetzt bei grenzüberschreitenden, konzerninternen Transaktionen. Es stellt sich die Frage, ob neue Funktionen durch ESG-Anforderungen entstehen.

                    <li><strong>HR und Vergütung / Steuern:</strong> ESG-konforme Vergütungsbestandteile (z.B. ÖPNV-Zuschuss, Fahrradleasing, Weiterbildung, Kinderbetreuung, faire Vergütung, Mitarbeiterbeteiligung) helfen, gesellschaftliche Verantwortung zu erfüllen, Mitarbeiterengagement zu fördern und Risiken zu minimieren.

                    <li><strong>Fördermittel:</strong> Bundesministerien und EU stellen Fördermittel für Klima-, Umwelt-, Nachhaltigkeitsvorhaben bereit. Identifizierung und strategische Beantragung von Fördermitteln (auch Steuervergünstigungen für Erneuerbare) sind Teil der Finanzierung (Green Finance) zur Realisierung von ESG-Zielen.

                    <li><strong>Immobilien:</strong> ESG tax Aspekte umfassen steueroptimierte Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien auf Grundstücken, Tax Due Diligence mit ESG-Bezug bei Ankäufen zur Risikoidentifikation und ESG-/steueroptimierte Haltestrukturen zur Vermeidung von Preisabschlägen beim Exit.
